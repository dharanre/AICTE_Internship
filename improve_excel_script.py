# === Improvements Made ===
# 1. Added automatic header detection
# 2. Removed empty rows and columns
# 3. Standardized column names (stripped whitespace, lowercase)
# 4. Added basic data type inference
# 5. Exported cleaned DataFrame to a new file

Description:
This improved script performs basic data cleaning on the provided Excel file:
- Loads the file into a DataFrame.
- Drops completely empty rows and columns.
- Standardizes column names for easier handling.
- Infers more appropriate data types for better processing.
- Exports the cleaned data to a new Excel file.

This makes the data more usable for analysis or further processing.
